    *   **Body**: **Lato** or **Open Sans** - Clean and legible.

## 3. 🗣️ Emma's Design Principles for Amorly

1.  **Readability is Love**: If they can't see it, they can't share it. High contrast always.
2.  **Less Noise, More Signal**: Remove distracting backgrounds. Focus on the relationship data.
3.  **Positive Reinforcement**: Use colors that signify growth (Green) and love (Pink/Coral) gently.
