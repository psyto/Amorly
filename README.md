**The App to Align Your Relationship Values Without Talking About Money.**

---

## 1. Product Overview (What)

* **Product Concept:** "Aligning values without having to talk about money."
* An **emotion-driven date budget planning app** for couples in a relationship.
* Unlike traditional budgeting or split-bill apps, it visualizes **feelings** like "comfort," "burden," and "security" *before* focusing on numbers, providing an experience that naturally harmonizes spending sensibilities.

## 2. The Problem We Solve (Problem)

**A Global, Universal Issue:**

* **Men** often default to **"grand gestures = expression of love,"** leading them to overextend themselves financially.
* **Women** often feel burdened but find it difficult to speak up.
* **Money** is one of the **most challenging topics** for couples, regardless of culture.
* **Result:** Value misalignment $\rightarrow$ Awkwardness $\rightarrow$ Distrust $\rightarrow$ Breakup in many cases.

## 3. The Solution (How)

**The Experience This App Provides:**

1.  **Emotion-First Design:**
    * Couples rate their expenditure not by amount, but by **"How comfortable did this feel?"** using a slider.
        * **Comfort** (Feels good)
        * **Stretch** (A slight splurge)
        * **Pressure** (Feeling the burden)
2.  **Date-Specific Micro-Goals:**
    * Examples:
        * "This week is a **'stay-within-our-means'** week."
        * "The anniversary is a **'slight splurge'** day."
        * "We aim for $X$ non-straining dates per month."
3.  **The "No-Conversation" Mechanism:**
    * The app automatically proposes a **"comfortable baseline for the two of you"** without requiring an awkward discussion.

## 5. Market Opportunity (Why Now)

* A couple-focused finance market already exists, resulting in **low user education costs.**
* However, the intersection of **"Relationship Psychology + Money"** remains a white space.
* While cultural differences exist globally, the **conflict points are universal** (the chivalry dilemma, the splitting-the-bill dilemma, the keeping-up-appearances dilemma).
